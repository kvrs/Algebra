what is algebra ?
 Algebra is the branch of mathematics that uses symbols, like letters, to represent unknown numbers and relationships, allowing for the generalization of arithmetic operations and the solution of equations.It provides a framework for manipulating expressions and solving problems where quantities are not fixed, such as in science, engineering, and everyday situations. 

 ## Algebra: 
Eamples:

 y = 2x-1
 
 x   |    Substitution            |   y
----------------------------------------------
 -2  |  y = 2(-2) - 1  = -4 - 1   |  -5
 -1  |  y = 2(-1) - 1  = -2 - 1   |  -3
  0  |  y = 2(0)  - 1  =  0 - 1   |  -1
  1  |  y = 2(1)  - 1  =  2 - 1   |   1
  2  |  y = 2(2)  - 1  =  4 - 1   |   3

Geometry is a kind of mathematics that deals with shapes and figures. Geometry explains how to build or draw shapes, measure them, and compare them. People use geometry in many kinds of work, from building houses and bridges to planning space travel.
