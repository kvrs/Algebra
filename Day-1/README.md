## What is Linear Algebra? 
 Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics focused on vectors, vector spaces, linear transformations, and systems of linear equations, essentially the algebra of lines and planes in higher dimensions, providing tools to model 
and solve complex problems in science, engineering, computer graphics, and especially modern machine learning by representing data as vectors and matrices for efficient computation. 

### 1.1 Organizing Information 

1. Introduction

Why organizing information matters in mathematics and real-world problems.
Common issues when data is not organized (ambiguity, errors).

2. What Does Organizing Mean in Linear Algebra?

Representing data as vectors and matrices.
Fixing an order for components to avoid ambiguity.
Example: Stock portfolio problem.

3. Example: Stock Portfolio

Prices: Google = $24, Netflix = $35, Apple = $80.
