## What is Linear Algebra? 
 Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics focused on vectors, vector spaces, linear transformations, and systems of linear equations, essentially the algebra of lines and planes in higher dimensions, providing tools to model 
and solve complex problems in science, engineering, computer graphics, and especially modern machine learning by representing data as vectors and matrices for efficient computation. 

### 1.1 Organizing Information 

1. Introduction

Why organizing information matters in mathematics and real-world problems.
Common issues when data is not organized (ambiguity, errors).

2. What Does Organizing Mean in Linear Algebra?

Representing data as vectors and matrices.
Fixing an order for components to avoid ambiguity.
Example: Stock portfolio problem.

3. Example: Stock Portfolio

Prices: Google = $24, Netflix = $35, Apple = $80.

1.2 What are Vectors?

   Vector is an object that has both magnitude and direction.  Geometrically, we can picture a vector as directed line segment, whose leangth is the magnitude of the vector and with arrow indicating the direction. 
   The direction of the vector is from its tail to its head.

    vector a & vector b as per above diagram 
    

   example: Lets think of an example of what wouldn't and what would be a vector? 
            --> if someone tells you that something is moving at 5 miles per hours, this information by itself is not vector quantity . its only specifiying magnitude .
            --> we don't know what direction this things is moving 5 miles per hour. so this right over here, which is offen reffered to as a speed is not a vector quantity  just by itself 
            --> this is consider scaler quantity. if want it to be a vector, we would also have to specify the direction.
            examples: someone might say it's moving 5 miles per hour east. So let's say it's moving 5 miles per hour due east. So now this combined 5 miles per are due east, this is a vector quantity.

1.2.1 Real coordinate spaces?  

       Real coordinate spaces all possible real values 2-tuples  
       what is tuple? its ordered list 
       
       R^2 = 2-tuple
          [3,4] = [3]
                  [4]
      R^3 = 3-tuples
      [0,1,2] = [0]
                [1]
                [2]
