## What is Linear Algebra? 
 Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics focused on vectors, vector spaces, linear transformations, and systems of linear equations, essentially the algebra of lines and planes in higher dimensions, providing tools to model 
and solve complex problems in science, engineering, computer graphics, and especially modern machine learning by representing data as vectors and matrices for efficient computation.
